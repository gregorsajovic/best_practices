# Solidity language best practices

When programming in solidity we should follow these guides:


### Layout of Contract:
- version
- imports
- errors
- interfaces, libraries, contracts
- Type declarations
- State variables
- Events
- Modifiers
- Functions


### Layout of Functions:
- constructor
- receive function (if exists)
- fallback function (if exists)
- external
- public
- internal
- private
- internal & private view & pure functions
- external & public view & pure functions


And [here](./ExampleContract.sol) is the example of solidity contract how it should be structured.
